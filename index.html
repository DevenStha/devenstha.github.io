    <h1> Why I gave up on Linux gaming</h1>
    <img src = "images/plygonTux.png" alt = "Polygon version of Tux (The Linux Mascot)" id = "tuxPolygon"/>
    <p> Linux is cool and all but I have to give up on daily driving due to following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Microstutters</li>
            <li>Windows Media Foundation videos [ Biggest Reason ]</li>
            <li>Paranoia because I didn't want to miss out on any cutscene because I happened to play a game with media foundation and it didn't play or straight up crashed souring my mood</li>
            <li>I have a fucking NVIDIA GPU, and the performance is worse compared to windows</li>
            <li>Non gaming related but goddamn when I open my laptop from sleep, a lot of the times it just freezes after I enter password and try to get back
                Btw, This happened in KDE Plasma upto version 6.3 (Wayland) in my Hybrid Intel + Nvidia Laptop
            </li>
            <li> And no, freeze after sleep happens even if I didn't run any updates and forgot to restart whatsoever </li>
            <li> Also sometimes my laptop just randomly freezes and no key works and I am forced to force restart my laptop, it has never happened to me in Windows </li>
        </ul>

    <p>My laptop spec: </p>

        </ul>
    <p> So, that why I gave up on Linux and came back to <a href = "https://massgrave.dev/windows_ltsc_links" id = "win10">Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021</a></p>
    <p>No way in hell I will ever use non LTSC version of Windows</p>
    <p id = "Hope">Btw I found this wonderful <a href = "https://github.com/ImSwordQueen/Win10to7Issues" id = "windows7theme">Windows 7 Theme </a> for Windows 10 and I love it, so not everything is bleak (●'◡'●)</p>
    <p>It looks absolutely gorgeous, the developer also modded in Windows 7 logonUI so I adore it (*￣▽￣*)ブ</p>
    <p>This is what it looks like: </p>

    <p> Update: I no longer use Windows 7 Theme and just use default Windows 10 Dark Theme as it removed the feature to
        change lock screen and the registry hack you used to change lockscreen in real Windows 7 works until you restart the laptop
        and the worst thing is that when you uninstall the theme the ability to change lock screen wallpaper is forever gone and I couldn't 
        find any way to restore it. I reinstalled Windows 10 because I feared that it might have broken something else I was unaware of and would
        bite me in the ass in the future.
